# Shipt Coding Challenge

This is a quick coding challenge I completed for Shipt 

To run application please follow steps 

1. yarn install 
2. yarn build
3. yarn serve

Thanks again to Shipt for giving me this opportunity and honestly it was pretty fun!

*Note for Shipt
I am using a CORS proxy to solve the "No Access-Control-Allow-Origin header" issue when pulling API data. So please excuse any slowness!
