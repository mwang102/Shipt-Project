# Shipt Coding Challenge

This is a quick coding challenge I completed for Shipt 

Please follow these steps to view the application in its production build!

1. yarn install 
2. yarn build
3. yarn serve

Thanks again to Shipt for giving me this opportunity. It was honestly pretty fun!

*Note for Shipt
I am using a CORS proxy to solve the "No Access-Control-Allow-Origin header" issue when pulling API data. So please excuse any slowness

etc
